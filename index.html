                <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan was a brilliant Indian mathematician who made extraordinary contributions to
                    number theory, mathematical analysis, infinite series, and continued fractions, despite having
                    almost no formal training. Known for his intuition and ability to produce profound results, he is
                    famous for his work on concepts like the Hardy-Ramanujan number (\(1729\))</p>

                <p>Web development is the process of building, creating, and maintaining websites and web applications
                    that are accessible online. This field includes a wide range of tasks, from front-end design (the
                    part users see) to back-end programming (the server-side logic and databases) and database
                    management. Ultimately, it's about creating functional, user-friendly, and accessible</p>

                <p>Python is a widely used and versatile programming language suitable for web development, particularly
                    for building the backend logic of web applications. While Python is not directly used for frontend
                    development (which primarily relies on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), it excels in handling server-side
                    operations.</p>

            <h1>Machine learning tutorial</h1>
            <p>Machine learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that uses algorithms to enable computers to
                learn from data and make predictions without being explicitly programmed. Instead of writing code for
                every specific task, you provide a system with data, and it identifies patterns to make decisions or
                predictions on new, unseen data. For instance, an ML algorithm can be trained on thousands of images</p>
